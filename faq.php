  <h4>Our Inventory</h4><br>
  <p>Q: What should I look for when I test drive a car? <br>
	 A: When you test drive a new car from us at car dealership, we recommend that you keep a checklist of items like comfort, utility, functionality, ease of use with tech features, and the general driving experience. This will help you get a better sense of whether the model matches your driving style and buying criteria. <br><br>
	 Q: Is there a day of the month that’s best for purchasing a new car? <br>
	 A: While an ideal time to buy varies on factors like the model of interest, your budget, and availability, we might recommend stopping by during a weekday since weekends tend to be a busy time for car shoppers. We also encourage you to check in to see when new models arrive at our dealership and stay up to date about deals and incentives that might work to create an ideal buying time for you.
  </p><br>
  <h4>Service and Parts</h4><br>
  <p>Q: What kind of services do you offer at your shop?<br>
	 A: We are proud to offer a range of maintenance services like fluid inspections, oil changes, tire rotations, and brake checks. Our center is also equipped to service your vehicle in the event of a minor or serious traffic accident. You can always expect attentive and prompt service.<br><br>
	 Q: Do you offer express service?<br>
	 A: Yes. If you’re in need of a quick check or procedure, we encourage you to take advantage of our express service. Whether you need an oil change or multi-point inspection, we can take care of it for you quickly and accurately.
